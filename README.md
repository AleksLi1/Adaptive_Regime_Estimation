# Adaptive Regime Estimation
This code is based on [Maewal and Bock (2018)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3272080), and calculates which regime the markets currently are in. Please note that this is not the full Modified Risk Parity algorithm, but only contributes to the estimation of the return exponent, Î±, as described in the paper.
